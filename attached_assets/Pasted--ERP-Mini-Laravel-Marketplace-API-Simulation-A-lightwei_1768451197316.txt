🧩 ERP Mini (Laravel) + Marketplace API Simulation

A lightweight and stable Laravel-based Mini ERP application that demonstrates core ERP workflows—product management, inventory movements, order processing, and simulated marketplace integration—designed for internship and junior web developer recruitment.

🧠 Extended Description

ERP Mini (Laravel) + Marketplace API Simulation is a responsive web application built with Laravel and SQLite to simulate a simplified yet realistic ERP system commonly found in small to medium businesses. The project focuses on demonstrating practical Laravel fundamentals such as migrations, seeders, Form Request validation, structured CRUD operations, and clean application flow, while avoiding unnecessary complexity that could introduce instability. Core ERP modules include Products management, Inventory stock movements (in/out), Orders with a clear status workflow (new, packed, shipped, done), and a Marketplace Sync feature implemented as a safe mock using local JSON imports and local status logs instead of real external APIs. This approach highlights an understanding of ERP concepts and API integration patterns without exposing the application to risks like token expiration, rate limits, or third-party service failures, making the project stable, easy to test, and highly suitable as a job-ready portfolio for Laravel-based roles.

📄 Short Description

A responsive Laravel + SQLite mini ERP featuring Products, Inventory movements, Orders workflow, and a mock marketplace integration using local JSON, built to demonstrate job-ready Laravel and ERP fundamentals.

🎯 Project Goals (For Recruiters)

This project is intended to demonstrate:

Laravel fundamentals (routing, controllers, Blade, validation)

ERP-style business flow (products → inventory → orders)

Clean CRUD structure with migrations and seeders

Safe API integration concepts using mock data

Stable, low-risk architecture suitable for real work environments

🧩 Main Features
1️⃣ Products

Create, read, update, and delete products

SKU-based identification

Basic search and listing

Validation to ensure data consistency

2️⃣ Inventory Management

Stock In and Stock Out transactions

Automatic stock calculation based on movement history

Prevention of invalid stock operations (e.g. negative stock)

3️⃣ Orders

Order creation with product snapshot

Status workflow: new → packed → shipped → done

Simple, readable order lifecycle

4️⃣ Marketplace Sync (Mock)

Import orders from a local JSON file

Simulated status push recorded in local logs

No real API calls, tokens, or external dependencies

🗂️ Database Structure (SQLite)

products: product master data

inventory_movements: stock in/out history

orders: order headers and status

order_items: product details per order

marketplace_push_logs: simulated API status updates

All tables are created using Laravel migrations and populated with seeders for initial testing.

📱 Mobile & UX

Responsive, mobile-first layout

Desktop sidebar and mobile-friendly navigation

Ready for PWA enhancement

Clear forms with validation feedback

🧪 How to Use (Quick Guide)

Open Dashboard to see overall summary

Add a Product

Record Stock In to increase inventory

Import mock orders from a JSON file

Update order status and review marketplace sync logs

This flow mirrors a simplified real-world ERP usage scenario.

✅ Testing Checklist

Import mock orders → orders appear correctly

Update order status → status log is created

Invalid form input → validation error shown, data preserved

Stock out exceeding available stock → operation blocked

Empty database → UI shows empty state, not errors

🛡️ Stability & Anti-Error Design

Laravel migrations and seeders for predictable setup

Form Request validation for all critical inputs

Simple queries, no heavy joins or background jobs

Mock marketplace integration to avoid external failures
